## Branch Rules
When committing a major change, it is highly suggested that you create a new branch following the naming scheme below:

`Username/Change`

Where "Username" is your name and "Change" is the major change you are making. Ex: `XlXi/Rewrite-2`.
These branch rules allow me to merge changes using GitHub's web interface rather than Visual Studio. It's a major time saver, so just follow the branch rules.
